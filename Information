While i know this wont be read by anyone,

Jack launcher is/will be a highly customisable and functional Fortnite private server launcher on first release wil benefits of early access. (Estimated release: 1W)
Jack launcher will then be able to launch into lobby on 2nd release.
Jack launcher will then be able to go in game.
Finally Jack launcher will also have downloadable mods.

I certainly hope this will not take more than 3 months to complete and note i very quickly get bored of this stuff because it goes out of trend extremely fast!

Thank you and on release enjoy!
